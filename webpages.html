    <h3 style="color:yellow;">ABOUT THE CLUB</h3>
    <p style="color:chocolate;font:bold;"><img src="C:\Users\Reliance\Pictures\Screenshots\7_CvM9U6_400x400.jpg" alt="logo" style="float:right;width:400px;height:250px;">Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Spanish, English, and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More than a club"). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the fourth-most valuable sports team in the world, worth $4.06 billion, and the world's richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €840,8 million.The official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barça", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.Barcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the largest social media following in the world among sports teams.Barcelona players have won a record number of Ballon d'Or awards (12), with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record number of FIFA World Player of the Year awards (7), with winners including Ronaldo, Romário, Ronaldinho, and Rivaldo. In 2010, three players who came through the club's youth academy (Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta, and Xavi) were chosen as the three best players in the world in the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards, an unprecedented feat for players from the same football school. Additionally, players representing the club have won a record number (8) of European Golden Shoe awards.Barcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera División that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid.</p>
    <h3 style="color:yellow">CLUB HISTORY</h3>
    <p style="color:deeppink;font:bold;">On 22 October 1899, Hans Gamper placed an advertisement in Los Deportes declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November. Eleven players attended – Walter Wild (the first director of the club), Lluís d'Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons – and Foot-Ball Club Barcelona was born.FC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups, competing in the Campionat de Catalunya and the Copa del Rey. In 1902, the club won its first trophy, the Copa Macaya, and participated in the first Copa del Rey, losing 1–2 to Bizcaya in the final.In 1908, Hans Gamper – now known as Joan Gamper – became club president in a desperate attempt to save Barcelona from extinction, finding the club struggling not just on the pitch, but also financially and socially, after not winning a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905. He said in a meeting, "Barcelona cannot die and must not die. If there is nobody who is going to try, then I will assume the responsibility of running the club from now on."Club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, he spent 25 years in total at the helm. One of his main achievements was ensuring Barça acquire its own stadium and thus generate a stable income.</p><img src="C:\Users\Reliance\Pictures\Screenshots\114916541.0.jpg" alt="team" style="width:400px;height:250px;" ><p style="color:deeppink;font:bold;">In 1978, Josep Lluís Núñez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as Diego Maradona, Romário and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.In June 1982, Diego Maradona was signed for a world record fee of £5 million from Boca Juniors.In the following season, under coach César Luis Menotti, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Madrid. Maradona's time with Barcelona, however, was short-lived and he soon left for Napoli. At the start of the 1984–85 season, Terry Venables was hired as manager and he won La Liga with noteworthy displays by German midfielder Bernd Schuster. The next season, he took the team to their second European Cup final, only to lose on penalties to Steaua București during a dramatic evening in Seville.In 1988, Johan Cruyff returned to the club, this time as manager and he assembled what would later be dubbed the "Dream Team".He used a mix of Spanish players like Pep Guardiola, José Mari Bakero, Jon Andoni Goikoetxea, Miguel Angel Nadal and Txiki Begiristain while signing international players such as Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Romário and Hristo Stoichkov.As coach of the "Dream Team", Johan Cruyff won four consecutive league titles with Barcelona.They beat Sampdoria in both the 1989 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley, with a free kick goal from Dutch international Ronald Koeman. They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the European Super Cup in 1992 and three Supercopa de España trophies. With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the club's most successful manager at that point. He also became the club's longest consecutive serving manager, serving eight years. Cruyff's fortune was to change, and, in his final two seasons, he failed to win any trophies and fell out with president Josep Lluís Núñez, resulting in his departure. On the legacy of Cruyff's football philosophy and the passing style of play he introduced to the club, future coach of Barcelona Pep Guardiola would state, "Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it.</p><p style="color:deeppink;font:bold;">"Cruyff was briefly replaced by Bobby Robson, who took charge of the club for a single season in 1996–97. He recruited Ronaldo for a world record transfer fee from his previous club, PSV and delivered a cup treble, winning the Copa del Rey, UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the Supercopa de España, with Ronaldo registering 47 goals in 49 games.Like Maradona, Ronaldo only stayed a short time before he left for Inter Milan in another world record transfer.However, new heroes emerged, such as Luís Figo, Patrick Kluivert, Luis Enrique and Rivaldo, and the team won a Copa del Rey and La Liga double in 1998. In 1999, the club celebrated its centenari, winning the Primera División title, and Rivaldo became the fourth Barcelona player to be awarded European Footballer of the Year. Despite this domestic success, the failure to emulate Real Madrid in the Champions League led to van Gaal and Núñez resigning in 2000.The departures of Núñez and Van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went.</p><p style="color:deeppink;font:bold;"> Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a first-round Champions League exit, and was dismissed late in the season. Long-serving Barcelona deputy coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season against Valencia via an exceptional performance from Rivaldo, who completed arguably the greatest hat-trick in history with an overhead bicycle kick winner in the final minute to secure qualification.After the disappointment of the Gaspart era, the combination of a new young president, Joan Laporta, and a young new manager, former Dutch and Milan star Frank Rijkaard, saw the club bounce back. On the field, an influx of international players, including Ronaldinho, Deco, Henrik Larsson, Ludovic Giuly, Samuel Eto'o, Rafael Márquez and Edgar Davids, combined with home grown Spanish players, such as Carles Puyol, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi and Víctor Valdés, led to the club's return to success. Barcelona won La Liga and the Supercopa de España in 2004–05, and Ronaldinho and Eto'o were voted first and third, respectively, in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards.Despite being the favourites and starting strongly, Barcelona finished the 2006–07 season without trophies. A pre-season US tour was later blamed for a string of injuries to key players, including leading scorer Eto'o and rising star Lionel Messi. There was open feuding as Eto'o publicly criticised coach Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. In La Liga, Barcelona were in first place for much of the season, but inconsistency in the New Year saw Real Madrid overtake them to become champions. Barcelona advanced to the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, winning the first leg against Getafe 5–2, with a goal from Messi bringing comparison to Diego Maradona's goal of the century, but then lost the second leg 4–0. They took part in the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup, but were beaten by a late goal in the final against Brazilian side Internacional.</p><p style="color:deeppink;font:bold;">Barcelona B youth manager Pep Guardiola took over Frank Rijkaard's duties at the conclusion of the season.Guardiola brought with him the now famous tiki-taka style of play he had been taught during his time in the Barcelona youth teams. In the process, Guardiola sold Ronaldinho and Deco and started building the Barcelona team around Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Lionel Messi.Barça beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 in the 2009 Copa del Rey Final, winning the competition for a record-breaking 25th time. A historic 2–6 victory against Real Madrid followed three days later and ensured that Barcelona became 2008–09 La Liga champions. Barça finished the season by beating Manchester United 2–0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, with goals from Eto'o and Messi, to win their third Champions League title, and complete the first ever treble won by a Spanish team.The team went on to win the 2009 Supercopa de España against Athletic Bilbaoand the 2009 UEFA Super Cup against Shakhtar Donetsk,becoming the first European club to win both domestic and European Super Cups following a treble. In December 2009, Barcelona won the 2009 Club World Cup.Barcelona accomplished two new records in Spanish football in 2010 as they retained the La Liga trophy with 99 points and won the Supercopa de España for a ninth time.In November 2010, Barcelona defeated their main rival Real Madrid 5–0 in El Clásico. At the ceremony for the 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or in December, Barcelona's La Masia became the first youth academy ever to have all three finalists for the Ballon d'Or, with Messi, Iniesta and Xavi being named the three best players in the world for 2010.</p>

      <h3 style="color:yellow">WHAT MAKES BARCA A GREAT CLUB</h3>
      <p style="color:lime;font:bold;"><img src="C:\Users\Reliance\Pictures\Screenshots\lionelmessi-1280x720.jpg" alt="Lionel Messi" style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;">For years, people have wondered what exactly makes a football club great? Is it based off of success, legacy, or a special connection that fans have with that club?
         Especially in recent years, people from across the globe have developed the same sort of connection with FC Barcelona. Barcelona have some of the best players in the world, a strong legacy, and to many people, they are extremely likable.Not every player on Barcelona's squad is exactly a likable player (hello, Sergio Busquets) but for the most part, Barcelona's players are well-liked.For most clubs, their top players are hated by many, such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney, among many others.El Clasico is easily the best rivalry in the world today in terms of talent and the recent plot. The entertainment that comes from this rivalry is one that cannot be matched by any two sides in any sport at the moment.Being one of the two most dominating clubs in Spain has allowed Barcelona to amass an amazing total of trophies captured.With the likes of Cryuff and Maradona as former players for the club, Barcelona have also been able to recruit many of the greatest footballers ever to become part of their ranks.Barcelona have become compulsive winners throughout the last decade. With globalization continuing to galvanize football, Barça have claimed an impressive amount of silverware.This culminated in 2009, where Barcelona became the first and only football club to complete a sextuple.Part of the reason why Barcelona are so amazing is how their players are able to overcome some serious ailments. Eric Abidal had to deal with a tumor in his liver. Support from Abidal came from all over the world. This included Real Madrid, who wore shirts that supported Abidal on the eve of his surgery.Lionel Messi was also able to get growth hormone treatment that treated his growth hormonal deficiency by joining Barcelona over a decade ago.It is easy to root for a club that possesses some of the best players in the world, but Barcelona is able to bring these players together in a way that football fans love.Barcelona are able to have numerous stars starting every match and achieve success due in large part to this.The Camp Nou is the largest stadium in Europe and is certainly one of the most intimidating. With a capacity of 99,787, Barcelona is able to draw plenty of fans to all of their matches.With the inscription of Mes que un club (More than a club) inscribed into the seats of the stadium and a fantastic environment, the Camp Nou certainly is one of the best places in the world for a football match.What is greater for Barcelona to have than the greatest footballer in the world?Lionel Messi is an Argentinian footballer widely regarded as one of the greatest players of the modern generation. He plays for FC Barcelona and the Argentina national team.The 6 time Ballon d'or winner has often been described as Diego Maradona’s successor because of his prolific goal scoring record and ability to dribble past opponents.</p>
